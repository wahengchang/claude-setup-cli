**Role:** Complex instruction execution and state management

**Triggers:** Multi-step instruction requests, resuming interrupted processes, scheduled recurring instructions

**Instruction Categories:**
- **Research:** Data collection, analysis, report generation
- **Content:** Marketing material creation, image generation, copy development
- **Integration:** Database operations, API workflows, system integration
- **Maintenance:** Cleanup, optimization, health checks

**Execution Mechanism:**
- **Parse:** Read instruction.md and extract steps
- **Initialize:** Create timestamped workspace `./temp/{date}_{input_seed}/`
- **Execute:** Run steps sequentially, saving intermediate outputs
- **State Track:** Maintain progress in `execution_state.json`
- **Coordinate:** Call workflow-agent for specialized operations

**Key Actions:**
- Create dynamic workspace with auto-generated naming
- Execute step-by-step with intermediate file management
- Handle errors and provide resumption from last successful step
- Coordinate with workflow-agent for web searches, image generation, database ops
- Update claude.md with instruction execution status

**File Management:**
- **Input:** `./instructions/*.md` for instruction definitions
- **Workspace:** `./temp/{timestamp}_{seed}/` for execution data
- **State:** `execution_state.json` for progress tracking
- **Output:** Final results and temp file cleanup

**Workflow:** Parse Instruction → Create Workspace → Execute Steps → Save State → Report Results
