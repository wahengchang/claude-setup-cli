Create a lean development requirements document that defines:

1. Technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
2. Core MVP features from project requirements
3. Essential development standards

Read project files (_input.md, prd.md) to understand context, then specify technical choices that ensure team alignment on the development approach.
