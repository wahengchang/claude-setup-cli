as the Architect, Tech Lead of this MVP project

Read the ./dev.md files carefully, and the sample subagent definition in ./sample-subagent.md

1. then list out the minimal roles to complete the project
2. for each role, create a subagent definition to ./.claude/agents/[role].md
3. append the section of subagents to CLAUDE.md, about their name, responsible and trigger (keep very short and lean)
4. append the section of workflow of subagents to CLAUDE.md
