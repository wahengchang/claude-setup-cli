# Design â€” {{ purpose.name }}

## Scope
Minimal scaffolding for advisory agents and a labeled workflow, without execution, routing, guardrails, or telemetry.

## Architecture
- Agents: identity + memory notes
- Workflow: trigger + ordered state labels
- Configs: secrets contract only
- Docs: this DESIGN, a RUNBOOK, ADR template, and CHANGELOG

## Trade-offs
- Simplicity over automation; enforcement and routing are left to external systems.
- Easy to extend later with specialized packs.
